### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. One of the concepts I learned in this assignment is different jQuery methods that allow you to traverse the DOM. An example of one is the children() which selects the child elements of each element matched by the main selector. 
2. Another concept I learned in this assignment is different jQuery methods that allow you to manipulate the DOM. An example of one is the addClass() which adds the specified class name(s) to the selection. 
3. The last concept I learned in this assignment is different jQuery methods that allow you to modify HTML elements. An example of one is the append() which inserts content at the end of the selected elements.
